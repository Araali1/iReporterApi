## Overview
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.

This iReporter Api serves to create, edit, delete and retrieve redflag incidents that have been already created.
The endpoints are deployed at [iReporter Heroku](https://sringtho.herokuapp.com)

# Features

A user can:

- get all redflags in the database
- get a particular redflag in the database using its id
- edit the location of a particular redflag
- edit the comment of a particular redflag
- delete a particular redflag

## API Description ##

The corresponding endpoints and their functionalities are described below

|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
|POST /api/v1/red-flags                         | adds a redflag to the database(list)
|GET /api/v1/red-flags                          | retrieves all redflags stored in the database
|GET /api/v1/red-flags/<red_flag_id>            | retrives a particular redflag based on its id
